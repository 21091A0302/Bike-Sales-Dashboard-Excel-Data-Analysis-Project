Bike Sales Dashboard – Excel Data Analysis Project
📊 Overview
This Bike Sales Dashboard provides a visual and interactive analysis of customer behaviour based on key attributes such as age, income, distance, and purchasing status. It is built entirely in Microsoft Excel using built-in features like pivot charts, slicers, and custom formatting. The dashboard helps stakeholders understand patterns in bike purchasing behaviour, which can support marketing, sales strategies, and customer segmentation.

📌 Dashboard Sections Explained
1. Average Income vs Purchase
Objective: To analyse the relationship between average income and purchase decisions across genders.

Insights : Both males and females who purchased bikes had a higher average income compared to those who did not.

Male purchasers had the highest average income, suggesting income is a significant factor influencing buying behavior.

2. Purchase by Distance
Objective: To examine how the distance from the store affects bike purchase decisions.

Insights: Most purchases were made by customers living 0–1 miles from the store.

There’s a significant drop in purchases as distance increases, especially beyond 2 miles.

Indicates proximity to the store plays a major role in buying likelihood.

3. Purchase by Age
Objective: To assess which age groups are most likely to purchase bikes.

Insights : The Middle Age group shows the highest number of purchases.

The Old Age group shows fewer purchases, and the Young Age group falls in between.

Suggests marketing efforts may be most effective when targeted at middle-aged customers.

4. Purchase by Age Brackets (Donut Chart)
Objective: Visual breakdown of purchases by defined age brackets.

Insights : Reinforces the trend shown in the line graph: Middle Age dominates purchases.

Provides a quick visual reference to age-based customer segmentation.
